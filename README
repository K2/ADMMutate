DESCRIPTION:
   There is always more then one way to do it, right?

   A lot of the properties used here were pioneered from virii writers from 
   long ago.

   Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) have become more and more
   prevalent in the network environment these days.  They have lowered the
   administrative overhead of network security with automated event 
   logs and in some cases automated attack responses.  These systems
   typically employ a number of techniques to detect various network
   attacks.  

   * Signature analysis
   * Protocol analysis
   * Traffic pattern statistics

   These methods compliment each other and work together to identify, log
   and respond to network attacks.

   I have chosen to attack the signature analysis method with a
   technique very well known to virus enthusiasts, a polymorphic algorithm
   that is designed to impair the effectiveness of regexp's against known
   attack signatures. (signatures are typically several bytes that are known
   to be the same for every execution of the exploit)

   Polymorphism is the ability exist in multiple forms.  This being said,
   if the application level data is put through a mutation algorithm, you
   should have an equivalently functional, but completely unique code
   fragment.

   This technique is quite easy to adapt to the needs of the exploit
   coder.  Buffer overflow's in the traditional sense usually,
   have sufficient non operational code that when can be altered to
   perform a number of other tasks.  If we presume 1KB buffer
   (BUFSIZ on most systems), this is ample space to perform any operations
   we see fit.

   Example. 700 bytes of NOP's "N" (0x90), 80 bytes shellcode 
   "S"(exec /bin/sh), 200 bytes return address "R" (into NOP's someplace), in
   the form [NNNN][SSSS][RRRR].  What we attempt to do, is to encode the
   shellcode with a simple mechanism (xor) so that the shellcode will be unique
   to any NIDS sensor.  This should take care of any shellcode signature
   analysis, we can also easily tackle the NOP portion of the code by
   substituting NOP's for other instructions that bear no operational
   consequence to the remaining code.  Although we must be careful to
   substitute the NOP code with opcodes that are equivalent length, we would
   not want to return in the middle of an instruction.  Optionally, a weight
   can be placed on any of these potential NOP replacements so that substituted
   code may adhere to some statistical pattern.  

   So what do we have now?  We have encoded shellcode, and substituted NOP's,
   all we need is to place our decoder into the code.  What we have to be 
   careful about is to produce code that resists signature analysis.  It
   would not be cool if the IDS vendor could simply detect our decoder.
   Some techniques that are used here are multiple code paths, non operational
   pad instructions, out-of-order decoder generation and randomly generated
   instructions.

   For instance, if we intend to load a register with some known data (our
   decode key), we can push DATA, pop REGISTER or we can move DATA,REGISTER
   or CLEAR REGISTER, add DATA,REGISTER, etc... endless possibilities.
   Each instruction of the decoder can be substituted by any number equivalent
   instructions, so long as the algorithm is not changed.

   Another technique is non operational padding, to accomplish this, when
   generating the decoder we ensure that there are some spare CPU registers
   that are left available for any operation we see fit.  For example, on IA32
   EAX was selected, as it is optimized to be used with many
   instructions, and is occasionally the implicit target of an operation.
   This allows us to pad every instruction in our decoder with 
   one of or more JUNKS!!! MUL X EAX, SHR X EAX, TEST EAX,EAX, etc...
   (X is randomly selected from an array of integers that passed through all
   shellcode requirements.)

   To further reduce the pattern of the decoder, out-of-order decoders are now
   supported.  This will allow you to specify where in the decoder certain
   operational instructions may be located.

   Shellcode restrictions, now that we have shellcode that can be generated in
   a form that is random in nature, there may be some parameters we would like
   this shellcode to conform to.

   tolower(), toupper(), certain BANNED char's?  These are all obstacles that
   have to be dealt with to have functional shellcode.  All of them however
   are dealt with by using quite a large keyspace (2x16bit) to encode
   the shellcode.  I have been fortunate to see over 100,000 possible keys
   even with banned+toupper requirements.

   Currently, the mutated strings are generated from srand seeded with the
   current time, this rate should be sufficient for most uses  one random string
   per second.  There is a special case though, with offset brute force code, a
   need to generate random strings at very quick rate.  To accommodate this some
   architecture specific code has been added to the engine, most modern CPU's
   contain a tick/counter register that is updated by the CPU once every one
   or two cycles.  This allows us to get new values to seed srand with at an
   extremely high rate.

   How this is normally accomplished, all key's that are banned or are
   noncompliance are removed from the search, then the shellcode is encoded
   with every possible key remaining in the keyspace.  All keys that generated
   compliant shellcode are saved for later random selection.  We do a second
   round for fun :)

   What about the return addresses?
   Even though it is only a 4 byte repeating string, we can modulate the least
   significant byte with hope that it will still be valid when the target 
   is hit.  Most vulnerabilities require you to modify the offset for various
   reasons.  You can also optionally truncate the shellcode for increased 
   packet variance.

   As we encode/decode 32-bit quantities, with an 8-bit accumulator, this
   translates to 4 x 256, or about 1K of shellcode, this should be
   reasonable for most uses.  I've rarely seen shellcode > 1K.
   
   IDS defense, some have stated that the most prominent place for NIDS to
   detect polymorphic shellocode is the NOP section.  On IA32 I have approximately
   55 suitable 1byte standard NOP replacements.  Some will say that in a 1K
   overflow where approx 700bytes represents a 55/256 selection of possible
   codes, this could be a means for detection.  However, I do not believe an
   IDS could do this very effectively, IA32 instructions are variable length
   (1->16bytes) and it is not a simple matter of doing byte-per-byte analysis
   of the code they will have to decode the stream (bitwise), and thanks to
   CISC encodings there are many branch's in this logic, leading to increased
   processing overhead in the detection process.

   Sliding keys have been implmented on the IA32 archatechture.  This will
   effectivly eliminate the ability to recover the plaintext shellcode by means
   of the reversable nature of xor.  This means that every iteration of the
   decode loop will incrament the key by a random amount (32bit).  This 
   adds significantly the the strength of the encoded shellcode to resist
   any analysis, the key is 32bit modulated by a slide of equal size, giving us
   a maximum of 64bit key&slide combinations.

   Along the way you may learn that, for HPPA, there are independent I and D
   cache, so a flush will be required for each (for every word modified).  Not
   that easy though, along with each fic/fdc (flush I/flush D) you will need to
   sync (code 0x00040000), that totals 4 instructions, and 6 null bytes of
   bloat to the decoder plus the fact that you have to pad 7 instructions
   between where you are executing and what code you are modifying.  A context
   switch will not work either (tried with setreuid).  We do something tricky
   here, along the way I noticed that my coredumps were accurate (they had the
   cache flushed before they were written to disk), so it was logical to assume
   that a fork(); call should copy an operational image and begin to exec in
   that space. :)  The child lives, the parent dies.

   Let's also analyze the code segments of common applications, weigh the junk
   instructions to an equivalent percentage of frequency.

   Simple signature analysis unfortunately, cannot provide very high levels 
   of assurances.
   
FILES:
   ADMmutapi.h is the API glue,
   ADMmuteng.[ch] is the ADMmutatation API,
   m7 is a demo of the API, (exploit filter),
   vulnerable is local vulnerable program,
   vulnerable-remote is a remote vulnerable program (run from inetd),
   exp is an exploit that should exploit "vulnerable" cleanly
   expx is similar to exp, except it demo's the API in a typical exploit
   qp.c is a demo remote qpop linux sploit.
   zdec.* are skeleton's for the decoders

USAGE:
   In m7 I've added -U and -l for toupper/tolower resistant shellcodes,
   -c has been added to enable the output C ARRAY mode,
   I also added -u to enable the offset modulation routine,
   also, -t will truncate the buf by the specified amount some exploits
   have garbage @ the extreme tail end.
   it will either read the binary output from -x, or it will read stdin.
   multiple arch support has been integrated, (INTEL,SPARC) for now.
   MIPS and HPPA are planned soon.
   keys have been expanded from 8-bit -> 2 rounds of 16-bit.

   WHAT IT DO?
   Well, there are four required functions to the API,
   init_mutate, apply_key, apply_jnops, apply_engine.   

   There is one optional function.
   apply_offset_mod()

   And there is a control structure that needs to be filled in.

   struct morphctl mut;
   mut will have several members,

   mut.arch should be set to one of (DISABLE,IA32,SPARC,HPPA,MIPS,IA32_SLIDE),
   mut.lower would enable tolower() resilient code,
   mut.upper would enable toupper() resilient code,
   mut.omodulate will modulate the designated offset,
   mut.cipher is the cipher to use (it is randomly selected),
   mut.cipher2 is the second 16-bit key.
   mut.banned can be loaded with a char string that cannot appear in the
   final shellcode.  (this only effect's the encoded shellcode, if you want
   to ban codes that are in the engine itself or the junk nops, your going
   to have to edit their flag in ADMmuteng.h)

   init_mutate(struct morphctl *)
   This function should initialize pointers to the OS specific structures, 
   functions and limits that were specified in mut.arch; DISABLE, IA32, SPARC
   HPPA or IA32_SLIDE.

   apply_key(buff,E,N,struct morphctl *)
   This function takes in input buff, substitutes E bytes @ location buff+N
   with encoded bytes.  It also will find a key that will work with your
   processing options.  MUST BE CALLED AFTER init_mutate.

   apply_jnops(buff,N,struct morphctl)
   This function takes buff, substitutes the first N bytes
   with alternate "junk nops"

   apply_engine(buff,E,N,struct morphctl)
   This functions takes  buff, generates a decode engine, places it at location
   buff+N-strlen(of.the.engine).

   apply_offset_mod(buff,N,X,morphctl);
   This function takes buf, modifies N amount at location buff+X, and adheres
   to the options in morphctl, such that the return address will be unique on
   execution.

   Any non 0 return is an error.

   To use in your exploit, simply add (for IA32),
   ...
   #include "ADMmutapi.h"
   struct morphctl *mctlp;
   struct morphctl mut;
   mut.upper = 0; mut.lower = 0; mut.banned = 0; mctlp = &mut;
   mut.arch = IA32;
   ...
   init_mutate(mctlp);
   apply_key(buff, strlen(shellcode), nops-1, mctlp);
   apply_jnops(buff, nops-1, mut);
   apply_engine(buff, strlen(shellcode), nops-1, mut);
   ...

   and you have now a polymorphic shellcode.

EXTEND:  
   If anybody would like to extend architecture support, just write a decoder
   for use in ADMmuteng.h, and the appropriate mutate_fixup patch. That's
   it!!

TODO:
   add more reverseable polymorphisms (more then just xor)
   add more arch.
   new sparc decoder w/o isspace() char's.
   multibyte dynamic JUNK code. (only 1byte of dynamic instrucions is done now)
   add more comprehensive error reporting
   clean things up a bit.. coding style and flexibility :\
   possibly some anti-debugging/armour code.

CHANGES:
   added IA32_SLIDE, this will defeat any attempts to recover the original code
   up to 55 NOP replacements on IA32
   added weighted queuing
   ran spell check :)
   added out-of-order decoder generation
   removed some DEBUG stuff that was cluttering all to hell
   added dynamic instructions eg. ADD N,%EAX;
   added offset modulation
   added multiple arch support
   added 2x16-bit key's
   added output to C type char array.
   added buffer truncation
   added DISABLE architecture support!
   added some of (Sparc:TICK,HP:TIMER,ALPHA:PCC,Pentium:TSC,MIPS:COUNT)
         register seed's for rand (some sploits run many times/sec)

COMPATIBILITY:
   Solaris(2.x),IRIX(6.x),HPUX(11),Linux, OpenBSD(2.x),UnixWare(7.x),
   OpenServer(5.x), TRU64(5.x), NetBSD(1.x), FreeBSD(4.3)

BUGS:
   IA32:
      Due to str calculations, -1 from the NOPS when passing it to the mutate
      functions.  This really depends on how you use NOPS in your sploit
      though.
   
   HPUX:
      There's some instruction encoding issues right now, keep JMAX @ 2.

EXAMPLE:
(the -o OFFSET will be DIFFERENT for everything, this is so m7 know where
to stop encoding)

/* This example m7 just printf(buffer) to stdout */

snow:~/work/mnew/ADMmutate# ./vulnerable `./exp | ./m7 -i -o 0xbffff63e -n 0x90`
jmp = [0xbffff63e]      offset = [-550]
args 2
doing stuffz...
sh-2.03# exit

/* This next example m7 exec(vulnerable) itself) */

snow:~/work/mnew/ADMmutate# ./m7 -i -o 0xbffff67e -n 0x90 -x ./exp
jmp = [0xbffff67e]      offset = [-550]
args 2
doing stuffz...
sh-2.03# 

if you would like to see the shellcodes and some other of my debug stuff, -DDEBUG
as you can see the STR is different every time.
